  abstract = {The launch of the gamma-ray telescope Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) started a pivotal period in indirect detection of dark matter. By outperforming expectations, for the first time a robust and stringent test of the paradigm of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is within reach. In this paper, we discuss astrophysical targets for WIMP detection and the challenges they present, review the analysis tools which have been employed to tackle these challenges, and summarize the status of constraints on and the claimed detections in the WIMP parameter space. Methods and results will be discussed in comparison to Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes. We also provide an outlook on short term and longer term developments.},

  abstract = {We present cosmological parameter results from the final full-mission Planck measurements of the CMB anisotropies. We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash{}Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash{}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash{}Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash{}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash{}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash{}tau = 0.054\textbackslash{}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash{}theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash{}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash{}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash{}Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash{}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash{}sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash{}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash{}rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash{}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash{}sum m\_\textbackslash{}nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash{}Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract = {We present a new formalism designed to discover dark matter annihilation occurring in the Milky Way's dwarf galaxies. The statistical framework extracts all available information in the data by simultaneously combining observations of all the dwarf galaxies and incorporating the impact of particle physics properties, the distribution of dark matter in the dwarfs, and the detector response. The method performs maximally powerful frequentist searches and produces confidence limits on particle physics parameters. Probability distributions of test statistics under various hypotheses are constructed exactly, without relying on large sample approximations. The derived limits have proper coverage by construction and claims of detection are not biased by imperfect background modeling. We implement this formalism using data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to search for an annihilation signal in the complete sample of Milky Way dwarfs whose dark matter distributions can be reliably determined. We find that the observed data is consistent with background for each of the dwarf galaxies individually as well as in a joint analysis. The strongest constraints are at small dark matter particle masses. Taking the median of the systematic uncertainty in dwarf density profiles, the cross section upper limits are below the pure s-wave weak scale relic abundance value (2.2 x 10\^-26 cm\^3/s) for dark matter masses below 26 GeV (for annihilation into b quarks), 29 GeV (tau leptons), 35 GeV (up, down, strange, and charm quarks and gluons), 6 GeV (electrons/positrons), and 114 GeV (two-photon final state). For dark matter particle masses less than 1 TeV, these represent the strongest limits obtained to date using dwarf galaxies.},

We obtain limits on the annihilation cross-section for dark matter particle masses between 10 GeV and 100 TeV - the widest mass range ever explored by a single gamma-ray analysis. These limits improve on previously published Fermi-LAT and MAGIC results by up to a factor of two at certain masses.

  abstract = {The Andromeda Galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to us and has been the subject of numerous studies. It harbors a massive dark matter (DM) halo which may span up to \textasciitilde{}600 kpc across and comprises \textasciitilde{}90\% of the galaxy's total mass. This halo size translates into a large diameter of 42 degrees on the sky for an M31-Milky Way (MW) distance of 785 kpc, but its presumably low surface brightness makes it challenging to detect with gamma-ray telescopes. Using 7.6 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) observations, we make a detailed study of the gamma-ray emission between 1-100 GeV towards M31's outer halo, with a total field radius of 60 degrees centered at M31, and perform an in-depth analysis of the systematic uncertainties related to the observations. We use the cosmic ray (CR) propagation code GALPROP to construct specialized interstellar emission models (IEMs) to characterize the foreground gamma-ray emission from the MW, including a self-consistent determination of the isotropic component. We find evidence for an extended excess that appears to be distinct from the conventional MW foreground, having a total radial extension upwards of \textasciitilde{}120-200 kpc from the center of M31. We discuss plausible interpretations of the excess emission but emphasize that uncertainties in the MW foreground, and in particular, modeling of the H I-related components, have not been fully explored and may impact the results.},

Some dark matter satellites are expected to have hard gamma-ray spectra, finite angular extents, and a lack of counterparts at other wavelengths. We sought to identify LAT sources with these characteristics, focusing on gamma-ray spectra consistent with WIMP annihilation through the \$b \textbackslash{}bar b\$ channel.

  abstract = {Galaxy clusters are one of the prime sites to search for dark matter (DM) annihilation signals. Depending on the substructure of the DM halo of a galaxy cluster and the cross sections for DM annihilation channels, these signals might be detectable by the latest generation of \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$-ray telescopes. Here we use three years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data, which are the most suitable for searching for very extended emission in the vicinity of nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. Our analysis reveals statistically significant extended emission which can be well characterized by a uniformly emitting disk profile with a radius of 3\textbackslash{}deg that moreover is offset from the cluster center. We demonstrate that the significance of this extended emission strongly depends on the adopted interstellar emission model (IEM) and is most likely an artifact of our incomplete description of the IEM in this region. We also search for and find new point source candidates in the region. We then derive conservative upper limits on the velocity-averaged DM pair annihilation cross section from Virgo. We take into account the potential \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$-ray flux enhancement due to DM sub-halos and its complex morphology as a merging cluster. For DM annihilating into \$b\textbackslash{}overline\{b\}\$, assuming a conservative sub-halo model setup, we find limits that are between 1 and 1.5 orders of magnitude above the expectation from the thermal cross section for \$m\_\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{DM\}\}\textbackslash{}lesssim100\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}mathrm\{GeV\}\$. In a more optimistic scenario, we exclude \$\textbackslash{}langle \textbackslash{}sigma v \textbackslash{}rangle\textbackslash{}sim3\textbackslash{}times10\^\{-26\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}mathrm\{cm\^\{3\}\textbackslash,s\^\{-1\}\}\$ for \$m\_\{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{DM\}\}\textbackslash{}lesssim40\textbackslash,\textbackslash{}mathrm\{GeV\}\$ for the same channel. Finally, we derive upper limits on the \$\textbackslash{}gamma\$-ray-flux produced by hadronic cosmic-ray interactions in the inter cluster medium. We find that the volume-averaged cosmic-ray-to-thermal pressure ratio is less than \$\textbackslash{}sim6\textbackslash\%\$.},

We show that blazars account for 50\$\^\{+12\}\_\{-11\}\$\textbackslash,\textbackslash\% of the EGB photons (\${$>\$$}0.1\textbackslash,GeV), and that \{\textbackslash{}it Fermi\}-LAT has already resolved \$\textbackslash{}sim\$70\textbackslash,\textbackslash\% of this contribution. Blazars, and in particular low-luminosity hard-spectrum nearby sources like BL Lacs, are responsible for most of the EGB emission above 100\textbackslash,GeV. We find that the extragalactic background light, which attenuates blazars' high-energy emission, is responsible for the high-energy cut-off observed in the EGB spectrum. Finally, we show that blazars, star-forming galaxies and radio galaxies can naturally account for the amplitude and spectral shape of the background in the 0.1--820\textbackslash,GeV range, leaving only modest room for other contributions. This allows us to set competitive constraints on the dark-matter annihilation cross section.},

  abstract = {The detection of byproducts from particle annihilations in galactic halos would provide important information about the nature of the dark matter. Observational evidence for a local excess of high-energy positrons has motivated recent models with an additional interaction between dark matter particles that can result in a Sommerfeld enhancement to the cross section for annihilation. In such models, the cross section becomes velocity-dependent and may enhance the dark matter annihilation rate in the solar neighborhood relative to the rate in the early universe sufficiently to source observed fluxes of high-energy positrons. We demonstrate that, for particle interaction cross sections that increase with decreasing velocity, the kinematical structures of dark matter halos with interior density profiles shallower than isothermal, such as Navarro-Frenk-White or Einasto halos, may induce a further enhancement owing to the position-dependent velocity distribution. We provide specific examples for the increase in the annihilation rate with a cross section enhanced by the Sommerfeld effect. In dark matter halos like that of the Milky Way and Local Group dwarf galaxies, the effective cross section at the halo center can be significantly larger than its local value. The additional enhancement owing to halo kinematics depends upon the parameters of any model, but is a prediction of certain models aimed at explaining measured positron fluxes and can exceed an order of magnitude.},

For Navarro-Frenk-White density profiles, we quantify the scatter in the \$J\$-factor arising from the astrophysical uncertainty in the dark matter potential. We show that, in Sommerfeld-enhanced models, the ordering of the most promising dSphs may be different relative to the standard case of velocity-independent cross sections.

The Fermi-LAT observations from dSphs have set stringent constraints on the velocity independent annihilation cross section. However, the constraints from dSphs may change in velocity dependent annihilation scenarios because of the different velocity dispersions in galaxies. In this work, we study how to set constraints on the velocity dependent annihilation cross section from the combined Fermi-LAT observations of dSphs with the kinematic data. In order to calculate the gamma ray flux from the dSph, the correlation between the DM density profile and velocity dispersion at each position should be taken into account. We study such correlation and the relevant uncertainty from kinematic observations by performing a Jeans analysis. Using the observational results of three ultrafaint dSphs with large J-factors, including Willman 1, Reticulum II, and Triangulum II, we set constraints on the p-wave annihilation cross section in the Galaxy as an example.},

  abstract = {Milky Way dwarf spheroidal satellites are a prime target for Dark Matter (DM) indirect searches. There have been recent reassessments of the expected DM gamma-ray signals in case of long-range interactions, commonly known as Sommerfeld enhancement. Since details of the underlying DM phase-space distribution function become critical, there are potentially large uncertainties in the final result. We provide here a first attempt towards a comprehensive investigation of these systematics, addressing the impact on the expected DM flux from Milky Way dwarfs via Bayesian inference on the available stellar kinematic datasets. After reconsidering the study case of ergodic systems, we investigate for the first time scenarios where DM particle orbits may have a radial or tangential bias. We consider both cuspy and cored parametric DM density profiles, together with the case of a non-parametric halo modelling directly connected to line-of-sight observable quantities. The main findings of our work highlight the relevance of the assumed phase-space distribution: Referring to a generalized J-factor, namely the line-of-sight convolution of the spatial part in case of velocity-dependent annihilation rate, an enhancement (suppression) with respect to the limit of isotropic phase-space distributions is obtained for the case of tangentially (radially) biased DM particle orbits. We provide new estimates for J-factors for the eight brightest Milky Way dwarfs also in the limit of velocity-independent DM annihilation, in good agreement with previous results in literature, and derive data-driven lower-bounds based on the non-parametric modelling of the halo density. The outcome of our broad study stands out as a representative of the state-of-the-art in the field, and falls within the interest of current and future experimental collaborations involved in DM indirect detection programs.},

We find that for dark matter density profiles with steep inner slopes, the morphology of the Inner Galaxy gamma-ray emission in p-wave models can be made similar to the morphology in standard s-wave models. This similarity may suggest that model discrimination between s-wave and p-wave is challenging, for example, when fitting the Galactic Center excess. However, we show that it is difficult to simultaneously match s- and p-wave morphologies at both large and small angular scales.

  issn = {1475-7516},
  abstract = {Irrespective of the dark matter (DM) candidate, several potentially observable signatures derive from the velocity distribution of DM in halos, in particular in the Milky Way (MW) halo. Examples include direct searches for weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), \$p\$-wave suppressed or Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation signals, microlensing events of primordial black holes (PBHs), \{\textbackslash{}em etc\}. Most current predictions are based on the Maxwellian approximation which is not only theoretically inconsistent in bounded systems, but also not supported by cosmological simulations. A more consistent method sometimes used in calculations for direct WIMP searches relies on the so-called Eddington inversion method, which relates the DM phase-space distribution function (DF) to its mass density profile and the total gravitational potential of the system. Originally built upon the isotropy assumption, this method can be extended to anisotropic systems. We investigate these inversion methods in the context of Galactic DM searches, motivated by the fact that the MW is a strongly constrained system, and should be even more so with the ongoing Gaia survey. We still draw conclusions that apply to the general case. In particular, we illustrate how neglecting the radial boundary of the DM halo leads to theoretical inconsistencies. We also show that several realistic configurations of the DM halo and the MW baryonic content entail ill-defined DFs, significantly restricting the configuration space over which these inversion methods can apply. We propose consistent solutions to these issues. Finally, we compute several observables inferred from constrained Galactic mass models relevant to DM searches (WIMPs or PBHs), \{\textbackslash{}em e.g.\} moments and inverse moments of the DM speed and relative speed distributions.},

We identify the interactions that lead to s-wave or p-wave annihilation, and those that are chirality-suppressed. We also list the interaction structures that can interfere in scattering and annihilation processes. Using these results, we point out situations in which deviations from the standard lore are obtained.},

  abstract = {There has been interest recently on particle physics models that may give rise to sharp gamma ray spectral features from dark matter annihilation. Because dark matter is supposed to be electrically neutral, it is challenging to build weakly interacting massive particle models that may accommodate both a large cross section into gamma rays at, say, the Galactic center, and the right dark matter abundance. In this work, we consider the gamma ray signatures of a class of scalar dark matter models that interact with Standard Model dominantly through heavy vector-like fermions (the vector-like portal). We focus on a real scalar singlet S annihilating into lepton-antilepton pairs. Because this two-body final-state annihilation channel is d-wave suppressed in the chiral limit, we show that virtual internal bremsstrahlung emission of a gamma ray gives a large correction, both today and at the time of freeze-out. For the sake of comparison, we confront this scenario to the familiar case of a Majorana singlet annihilating into light lepton-antilepton pairs, and show that the virtual internal bremsstrahlung signal may be enhanced by a factor of (up to) two orders of magnitude. We discuss the scope and possible generalizations of the model.},

  volume = {82},
  issn = {1550-7998, 1550-2368},
  abstract = {The annihilation cross section of thermal relic dark matter determines both its relic density and indirect detection signals. We determine how large indirect signals may be in scenarios with Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation, subject to the constraint that the dark matter has the correct relic density. This work refines our previous analysis through detailed treatments of resonant Sommerfeld enhancement and the effect of Sommerfeld enhancement on freeze out. Sommerfeld enhancements raise many interesting issues in the freeze out calculation, and we find that the cutoff of resonant enhancement, the equilibration of force carriers, the temperature of kinetic decoupling, and the efficiency of self-interactions for preserving thermal velocity distributions all play a role. These effects may have striking consequences; for example, for resonantly-enhanced Sommerfeld annihilation, dark matter freezes out but may then chemically recouple, implying highly suppressed indirect signals, in contrast to naive expectations. In the minimal scenario with standard astrophysical assumptions, and tuning all parameters to maximize the signal, we find that, for force-carrier mass m\_phi = 250 MeV and dark matter masses m\_X = 0.1, 0.3, and 1 TeV, the maximal Sommerfeld enhancement factors are S\_eff = 7, 30, and 90, respectively. Such boosts are too small to explain both the PAMELA and Fermi excesses. Non-minimal models may require smaller boosts, but the bounds on S\_eff could also be more stringent, and dedicated freeze out analyses are required. For concreteness, we focus on 4 mu final states, but we also discuss 4 e and other modes, deviations from standard astrophysical assumptions and non-minimal particle physics models, and we outline the steps required to determine if such considerations may lead to a self-consistent explanation of the PAMELA or Fermi excesses.},

  abstract = {We propose a comprehensive theory of dark matter that explains the recent proliferation of unexpected observations in high-energy astrophysics. Cosmic ray spectra from ATIC and PAMELA require a WIMP with mass M\_chi \textasciitilde{} 500 - 800 GeV that annihilates into leptons at a level well above that expected from a thermal relic. Signals from WMAP and EGRET reinforce this interpretation. Taken together, we argue these facts imply the presence of a GeV-scale new force in the dark sector. The long range allows a Sommerfeld enhancement to boost the annihilation cross section as required, without altering the weak scale annihilation cross section during dark matter freezeout in the early universe. If the dark matter annihilates into the new force carrier, phi, its low mass can force it to decay dominantly into leptons. If the force carrier is a non-Abelian gauge boson, the dark matter is part of a multiplet of states, and splittings between these states are naturally generated with size alpha m\_phi \textasciitilde{} MeV, leading to the eXciting dark matter (XDM) scenario previously proposed to explain the positron annihilation in the galactic center observed by the INTEGRAL satellite. Somewhat smaller splittings would also be expected, providing a natural source for the parameters of the inelastic dark matter (iDM) explanation for the DAMA annual modulation signal. Since the Sommerfeld enhancement is most significant at low velocities, early dark matter halos at redshift \textasciitilde{}10 potentially produce observable effects on the ionization history of the universe, and substructure is more detectable than with a conventional WIMP. Moreover, the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies and Milky Way subhalos can greatly increase the substructure annihilation signal.},
